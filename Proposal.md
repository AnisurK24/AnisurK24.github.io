# Grid Algorithm Pathfinder

### This is an app that uses different algorithms in a grid to find an endpoint from a start point designated by a user.

### The user is also able to place blocks that the algorithm cant traverse.

### making every iteration unique.

----------

## MVP

1. Grid with the ability to create blocks.
2. Algorithms used to find the end point.
3. Visualization of algorithms.
4. Clean and attractive visual presentation.

--------

## Technologies

1. Plain old JavaScript
2. HTML
3. CSS
